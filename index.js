  TASK 1

    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Window Binding : this is not a useful principle but it is what happens when 'this' has no context, it will give the entirety of JS's global objects 
  2. Implicit Binding : (most common usage) , 'this' refers to whatever object is to the left of dot notation and to the right is whichever key/method you are trying to access
  3. Explicit Binding : triggered with .call(), .apply() and .bind(); .call() is used to invoke a function (left of dot) to a desired object (in the parentheses). 
  .bind() is very similar except you need to make a new function declaration to contain the result of your explicit binding. 
  4. New Binding : makes new objects with the 'new' keyword before a pre-existing constructor function that provides a framework for future objects with 'this' declarations.
